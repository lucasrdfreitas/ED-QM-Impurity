# ED-QM-Impurity

This script employs exact diagonalization to compute the magnon spectrum and spin expectation values in various Quantum Magnets featuring a magnetic impurity (adatom and substitution) coupled to a single site. 
These materials are effectively modeled by the $JK\Gamma$ extended Kitaev model. 
We will focus mainly on two materials:  $\text{RuCl}_3$ (e.g. 1706.06113) and $\text{CrI}_3$  (e.g. 1704.03849).
